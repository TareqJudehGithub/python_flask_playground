Flask

# 1.  Setup up a Flask server:
        from flask import Flask

        # Creating an instance of Flask class, named app:
        server_name = Flask(__name__)

        # *Route Decorator:
        @server_name.route("/")
        def hello_world():
            return "Hello, World!"

# 2.   In terminal export the Flask server in the Environment Variable:
        This will add main.py for Flask as the server name in the 'env'.
        $ export FLASK_APP=main.py

        This command starts the Flask server:

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            app.run()

        In Terminal:
        $ flask run
        We could also run: $ python -m flask

# 3. Debug mode: off (Auto-reload)
    Turn Debug mode ON, so the server updates changes automatically, instead
    of restarting the server everytime we make a change.

    To enable all development features (including debug mode) you can export
    the FLASK_ENV environment variable and set it to development before running the server:

    $ export FLASK_ENV=development
    $ flask run
    We could also set debug=True in app.run() line of code:
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
